# MalConv-Exploration
A Study on Computational Performance of Malware Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Final Project for COMSE 6998 - Hiph Performance machine Learning | Spring Semester 2023

## Description
### What We Set Out To Do:
As Malware identifiaction is an ever growing problem in today's vastly digitally interconnected landscape we set out to explore the field of malware recognition and detection from the side of machine learning networks. Networks such as the convolutional model explord herein have the potential to provide a flexible and bleeding edge solution to teh task of malware identification and we sought to not only better understand the current ML efforts towards this task but attempt to improve performance, from both a temporal and quantitive standpoint, through the implementation of knowledge learned throughout the course of the semester in this course.

### What's Here?
Here we Have a jupyter notebook containing many of the models we tested including graohs of the data and print outs of the training for each. Moreover we have atached our dataset (a small sample of 40 execs, 20 malware and 20 freeware) alongside the categorization CSV (containing labels for each executable) the scripts wee used to scrape and label this data (in the scripts directory), saved models from our various experiments (in the checkpoints directory), and an example cofiguration file for an experimental run. We also have the code we used to run inference analysis on our model and a writeup of our findings.

### How do I run all of this?
To Execute our code there is not much you need to know thanks to the use of our Jupyter notebooks! Ensure your paths are updated to point to the correct directories but other than that it should be a simple matter of running the cells in sequence for the project to execute as intended!

## Results and Observations
While a more comprehensive view of our results is available in the writeup, here is a brief overview of how to interpret our data:
